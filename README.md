# Testing a computational model of aesthetic value
Data and analysis files for an experiment testing the viability of [a computational model of aesthetic value developed by Brielmann and Dayan (in press)](https://psyarxiv.com/eaqkc/).
Analyses and plotting functions used here depend on the [main package containing the core functions of the computational model of aesthetic value](https://github.com/aenneb/intro-aesthetic-value-model).
